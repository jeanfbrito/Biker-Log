## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [Moto Sensor Logger Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to the project maintainers.

## I don't want to read this whole thing, I just have a question!

> **Note:** Please don't file an issue to ask a question. You'll get faster results by using the resources below.

* If you have a usage question, check the [README](README.md) first
* For technical questions about sensor data or calibration, see our [Wiki](../../wiki)
* For general discussion, use the [Discussions](../../discussions) tab

## What should I know before I get started?

### Project Overview

Moto Sensor Logger is a specialized Android application for recording motorcycle telemetry data using device sensors. The app focuses on:

* High-frequency sensor data collection (50-100Hz)
* Real-time calibration for motorcycle mounting positions
* Efficient CSV data logging with embedded metadata
* Live telemetry visualization

### Project Structure

```
app/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/main/java/com/motosensorlogger/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ calibration/     # Sensor calibration logic
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ data/            # Data models and CSV handling
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ services/        # Background services
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ views/           # Custom UI components
â”œâ”€â”€ src/test/            # Unit tests
â””â”€â”€ src/androidTest/     # Instrumentation tests
```

### Design Decisions

Before contributing, understand these key design principles:

1. **Performance First**: The app handles high-frequency sensor data. Any contribution must maintain performance.
2. **Data Integrity**: CSV logs are critical. Never compromise data accuracy or format consistency.
3. **Battery Efficiency**: Background services must be optimized for battery life.
4. **User Safety**: The app is used while riding. UI must be glanceable and non-distracting.

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

Before creating bug reports, please check existing issues as you might find out that you don't need to create one. When you are creating a bug report, please include as many details as possible:

* **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps**
* **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why**
* **Include logs** from `adb logcat` if applicable
* **Include device information** (model, Android version, app version)

#### Template for Bug Reports

```markdown

### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin? You can start by looking through these `beginner` and `help-wanted` issues:

* [Beginner issues](../../labels/good%20first%20issue) - issues which should only require a few lines of code
* [Help wanted issues](../../labels/help%20wanted) - issues which should be a bit more involved

### Pull Requests

The process described here has several goals:

- Maintain code quality
- Fix problems that are important to users
- Engage the community in working toward the best possible app
- Enable a sustainable system for maintainers to review contributions

Please follow these steps:

1. **Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature
   ```

2. **Set up your development environment**
   ```bash
   ./install.sh  # Automated setup script
   ```

3. **Make your changes**
   - Follow the [Kotlin Style Guide](#kotlin-style-guide)
   - Add tests for new functionality
   - Update documentation as needed

4. **Ensure the test suite passes**
   ```bash
   ./gradlew test
   ```

5. **Run code quality checks**

   ```

6. **Commit your changes**
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add feature: brief description"
   ```
   
   Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):
   - `feat:` New feature
   - `fix:` Bug fix
   - `docs:` Documentation only
   - `style:` Formatting, missing semicolons, etc
   - `refactor:` Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature

#### Pull Request Checklist

- [ ] My code follows the code style of this project
- [ ] I have performed a self-review of my own code
- [ ] I have commented my code, particularly in hard-to-understand areas
- [ ] I have made corresponding changes to the documentation

## Styleguides

### Git Commit Messages

* Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
* Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
* Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
* Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

### Kotlin Style Guide

We follow the [official Kotlin coding conventions](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coding-conventions.html) with these additions:

```kotlin
// Use meaningful variable names
val sensorFrequency = 100 // Good
val sf = 100 // Bad

// Prefer immutability
val items = mutableListOf<String>() // When mutation is needed
val items = listOf<String>() // Default to immutable

// Use explicit types for public APIs
fun calculateCalibration(data: SensorData): CalibrationResult // Good
fun calculateCalibration(data) // Bad

// Document public functions
/**
 * Calculates calibration parameters from sensor data
 * @param data Raw sensor data samples
 * @return Calibration result with quality metrics
 */
fun calculateCalibration(data: SensorData): CalibrationResult
```

### Documentation Style Guide

* Use [KDoc](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/kotlin-doc.html) for API documentation
* Include examples for complex functionality
* Keep documentation close to code
* Update documentation with code changes

### Testing Style Guide

```kotlin
class ExampleTest {
    @Test
    fun `should describe expected behavior when condition is met`() {
        // Given - setup
        val input = TestData()
        
        // When - action
        val result = systemUnderTest.process(input)
        
        // Then - verification
        assertEquals(expected, result)
    }
}
```
